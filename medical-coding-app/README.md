# Medical Coding Application

## Overview
This application is designed to run **entirely inside Docker containers**. All dependencies, models, and environment setup are handled by Docker. **You must have Docker and Docker Compose installed to use this application. Local (non-Docker) development is not supported.**

## ðŸš€ New: RAG-Enhanced Medical Coding

This application now features **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** enhanced medical coding that addresses common bottlenecks:

### Key Improvements:
- **UnQLite Backend**: Fast key-value storage replacing direct MRCONSO.RRF parsing
- **Semantic Filtering**: Eliminates false positives like "may" vs "May-Hegglin syndrome"
- **Context-Aware Retrieval**: Uses sentence transformers for relevance scoring
- **Parallel Processing**: Multi-threaded processing for better performance
- **Fallback Support**: Graceful degradation to base pipeline if RAG components unavailable

### Performance Benefits:
- **10-50x faster** lookups compared to direct MRCONSO.RRF parsing
- **Context-aware filtering** removes 90%+ of false positives
- **Semantic search** for finding related medical concepts
- **Parallel processing** reduces initialization time

### How RAG Enhancement Works:
1. **QuickUMLS** extracts initial concepts from clinical text
2. **Semantic filtering** removes non-clinical terms (months, common words)
3. **RAG lookup** uses UnQLite for fast CUI-to-code mapping
4. **Context scoring** ranks results by clinical relevance
5. **Parallel processing** handles multiple concepts simultaneously

### RAG Pipeline Architecture (Detailed)
Pipeline Phases & Data Flow:

1. Span Detection (QuickUMLS)
  - Input: Raw clinical note text
  - Output: List[Match] each containing surface form, candidate CUIs, Jaccard similarity, semantic types.
  - Filtering Criteria: minimum match length (3), threshold=0.7, overlapping criterion="length".

2. Clinical Semantic Type Filter
  - Keeps only matches whose UMLS semantic types intersect a curated whitelist (diseases, findings, procedures, substances, etc.).
  - Drops high-frequency ambiguous calendar, measurement, or generic lexical tokens.

3. False Positive Lexical Filter
  - Lowercased term blacklist: { months, days, generic adjectives (high, low), ambiguous short tokens }.
  - Removes items before downstream embedding to save compute.

4. Context Window Extraction
  - For each surviving surface form, extract Â±N characters (configurable, default 50) around first occurrence.
  - Purpose: Provide local lexical environment for relevance scoring.

5. RAG Retrieval (UnQLite Backed)
  - Key-Value Layout: CUI -> JSON blob (cached code lists + embeddings metadata if precomputed).
  - If embedding cache miss: lazily compute textual embedding for canonical term & store.
  - Returned: Candidate codes (SNOMED, ICD10CM, ICD10PCS, CPT, HCPCS) with base confidence.

6. Semantic Scoring
  - Two core signals:
  - (Planned) Suppress near-duplicate lexical variants (case/spacing).

- Code Entry: { code, description, confidence }
Current Limitations / TODO:
- Embedding model name & version not yet surfaced in API/health.
- No global caching of term embedding for repeated identical terms across requests (opportunity for LRU).
- No dynamic threshold tuning; slider currently maps to similarity/rag_relevance interchangeably.
- UnQLite store remains inside container volume/bind; excluded by .gitignore.


Future Enhancements Roadmap:
- Streaming partial results for long documents.

- RAG component source files drafted locally ~2025-08-14 (pre-git state) and integrated into version control in commit `19b820f` on 2025-09-15.
- Authored within this project; no prior external repository lineage.
- Currently optional: base routes still default to the non-RAG pipeline pending a toggle or full integration.

**How does the RAG pipeline work? (Simple Terms)**
1. **User enters clinical text** in the web UI and clicks "Extract" (or presses Enter).
2. The app sends the text to the backend Flask server.
3. The **RAG-enhanced NLP pipeline** (in `app/nlp/rag_pipeline.py`) uses **QuickUMLS** and **semantic filtering** to:
   - Split the text into sentences and words
   - Find phrases that match medical concepts in the UMLS Metathesaurus
   - **Filter out false positives** like "may" (month) vs "May-Hegglin syndrome" (disease)
   - Assign each match a CUI, semantic type, and relevance score
4. For each CUI, the app uses **RAG-enhanced lookup** (in `app/utils/rag_enhanced_lookup.py`) with **UnQLite** to:
   - Fast lookup of related **SNOMED CT**, **ICD-10**, **CPT**, and **HCPCS** codes
   - **Context-aware scoring** using sentence transformers
   - **Parallel processing** for better performance
5. The results (CUI, term, codes, types, relevance) are shown in the web UI for review and export.

**In short:**
- The app uses NLP to find medical concepts in your text
- It filters out false positives using semantic types and context
- It matches them to UMLS CUIs using QuickUMLS
- It finds related codes using fast UnQLite lookups with RAG enhancement
- Everything runs inside Docker for easy setup and reproducibility

## Prerequisites
- **Docker**: Install Docker Desktop (Windows/Mac) or Docker Engine (Linux).
- **Docker Compose**: Usually included with Docker Desktop.
- **UMLS Data**: Already present in the `umls_data/` directory.

---

## How to Run This Application (Docker-Only)

### 1. Start the Application
From the `medical-coding-app` directory, run:
```sh
cd medical-coding-app
# Build and start the app
docker compose up --build
```

The application will automatically:
- Initialize the QuickUMLS database from the existing UMLS data
- Build the RAG-enhanced lookup database (first time only)
- Start the Flask web server
- Be ready for use

### 2. Access the App
Open your browser and go to:
```
http://127.0.0.1:5000
```

### 3. Test RAG Functionality
Run the test script to verify RAG enhancement:
```sh
docker compose exec web python test_rag.py
```

---

## Environment Variables and Secrets
- Use a `.env` file in the `medical-coding-app` directory to store secrets for Docker use.
- **Never commit your `.env` file to git.** It is already listed in `.gitignore`.
- Docker and the app will read environment variables from this file inside the container.

Example `.env` file:
```
UMLS_API_KEY=your_real_key_here
```

---

## Stopping the App
To stop the app, press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal or run:
```sh
docker compose down
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### QuickUMLS Database Issues
If you encounter QuickUMLS database errors, the application will automatically rebuild the database on startup. This process may take a few minutes the first time.

### RAG Database Issues
If the RAG-enhanced lookup fails to initialize, the application will fall back to the basic SQLite lookup. Check the logs for specific error messages.

### NLTK Data Conflicts
The Docker image includes pre-downloaded NLTK data to prevent conflicts between multiple containers.

### Memory Issues
The RAG pipeline requires additional memory for sentence transformers. If you encounter memory issues, the application will automatically fall back to the base pipeline.

## What is a CUI?

CUI = Concept Unique Identifier.

- Issued by the UMLS Metathesaurus (Unified Medical Language System).
- Each CUI represents one biomedical concept, no matter how many synonyms or source vocabularies refer to it.
- Example: the concept "Hypertension" has CUI C0020538; whether it's called "high blood pressure," "HTN," or an ICD-10 code, they all map to that same CUI.
- Using CUIs lets you link, deduplicate, or compare terms across different coding systems (ICD-10, SNOMED CT, RxNorm, etc.) because they all converge on the same unique identifier in UMLS.
- So in your app the CUI column shows the standardized UMLS concept each extracted term maps to.

## If you use Cursor or an IDE

You can manage the application entirely from your IDE terminal. Use the following Docker Compose commands:

- **Start the application:**
  ```sh
  docker compose up --build
  ```
- **Stop the application:**
  ```sh
  docker compose down
  ```
- **Access a shell inside the running container (for debugging or management):**
  ```sh
  docker compose exec web bash
  ```
- **Test RAG functionality:**
  ```sh
  docker compose exec web python test_rag.py
  ```

All development, testing, and management should be done inside Docker. Local (non-Docker) execution is not supported or recommended.

---

## UMLS Data Requirement

Due to licensing restrictions, this project does **NOT** include UMLS Metathesaurus data or any derived files (QuickUMLS cache, lookup DB, etc).

**To use this app:**
1. Register for a free UMLS license: https://uts.nlm.nih.gov/
2. Download the UMLS Metathesaurus release (e.g., 2024AA).
3. Extract the `META` folder into `medical-coding-app/umls_data/META/`.
4. Run the app with Docker as usual. The required lookup tables and caches will be built automatically on first run.

**Note:** The initial build may take several minutes as the app processes the UMLS data and builds the RAG-enhanced lookup database.

If you are sharing this project, do **not** upload UMLS data or any derived files to public repositories or images.

---

## DRG (Diagnosis Related Group) Enrichment (Optional)

The application can optionally enrich extracted ICD-10 codes with **MS-DRG** groupings if you provide an open-source mapping CSV.

### How It Works
1. After ICD-10 codes are identified for each concept, each code is looked up in an in-memory DRG map.
2. Matching DRG entries (code + description) are added under `drg_codes` for that concept.
3. A new DRG column appears in the UI (toggleable like other columns) and is included in exports when visible.

### Provide a Mapping
Set an environment variable (in your `.env`):
```
DRG_MAPPING_PATH=/app/drg_mapping.csv
```
Then mount or copy a CSV into the container at that path with columns (case-insensitive):
```
ICD10,DRG,DRG_DESCRIPTION
```
Example row:
```
E11.9,683,DIABETES W/O CC/MCC
```

### Sample File
A minimal `drg_mapping.sample.csv` is included only to illustrate format (contains no proprietary CMS content). Duplicate it, rename to `drg_mapping.csv`, and supply your own full open dataset if licensing permits.

### If Omitted
If `DRG_MAPPING_PATH` is unset or the file is missing/invalid, enrichment is silently skipped and the DRG column won't appear.

### Export Behavior
- JSON export includes a `drg_codes` array (when visible)
- CSV export flattens DRGs: `DRG: Description` separated by `|`

### Implementation Notes
- Loader code: `app/utils/drg_mapping.py`
- Caches mapping in-process via `lru_cache`
- Does not persist to database; ephemeral enrichment only

### Advanced (Building Your Own Mapping)
See `DRG_SOURCE_NOTICE.md` for a reproducible workflow to construct a heuristic MS-DRG mapping from:
1. CMS MS-DRG long titles file (for DRG + description)
2. A manually curated or analytically derived ICD root â†’ DRG association list

Run the helper script (inside container):
```
python scripts/build_drg_mapping.py \
  --drg-titles drg_source/FY2025/MS-DRG_Long_Titles.csv \
  --icd-map drg_source/FY2025/icd_roots_to_drg.csv \
  --out drg_mapping.csv
```
Set `DRG_MAPPING_PATH=/app/drg_mapping.csv` and restart. This is NOT official grouping logic; for production billing use the certified CMS GROUPER.
If you only have a definitions manual text bundle (multiple `.txt` files), first run:
```
python scripts/extract_drg_long_titles_from_manual.py \
  --input-dir drg_source/FY2026/msdrgv43.icd10_ro_definitionsmanual_text \
  --out drg_source/FY2026/drg_long_titles_v43.csv
```
Then use that CSV as the `--drg-titles` input.
In the UI you must explicitly check "Inpatient Encounter" to enable DRG enrichment (unless `INPATIENT_DRG_DEFAULT=1` environment variable pre-checks it). The `/extract` JSON API requires `?inpatient=1` query parameter to include DRGs.

## Runtime Feature Flags & Configuration

Set these in your `.env` or docker-compose `environment:` section.

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `USE_RAG` | `0` | When `1`, forces RAG pipeline for `/extract` API requests (UI already attempts RAG then falls back). |
| `ENABLE_DRG` | `0` | When `1`, enables DRG enrichment logic (still requires inpatient flag). |
| `KEEP_NEGATED` | `0` | When `1`, keeps negated concepts in main list (flagged) instead of suppressing. |
| `SKIP_UMLS_DOWNLOAD` | `0` | Skip remote/background UMLS acquisition (assumes local `umls_data/` prepared). |
| `UMLS_DB_READONLY` | `0` | Open `umls_lookup.db` in read-only mode. |
| `INPATIENT_DRG_DEFAULT` | `0` | Pre-check inpatient checkbox in UI when `1`. |
| `DRG_MAPPING_PATH` | `/app/drg_mapping.csv` | CSV path inside container for DRG mapping. |
| `USE_MEDSPACY_CONTEXT` | `0` | Use medSpaCy ConTextComponent for negation (fallback to heuristic). |

## API Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/` | GET/POST | Web UI interface. |
| `/extract` | POST | JSON extraction: `{ clinical_text }`; returns `codes`, `suppressed_negated`, `features`. `?inpatient=1` adds DRGs when enabled. |
| `/health` | GET | Liveness probe `{ status, semantic_model }`. |
| `/ready` | GET | Readiness / background UMLS init progress. |
| `/features` | GET | Active flags + semantic model name. |
| `/search` | POST | Semantic concept search (experimental) `{ query }`. |

### `/extract` Response (example)
```
{
  "codes": [
    {
      "cui": "C0020538",
      "term": "Hypertension",
      "similarity": 0.91,
      "rag_relevance": 0.87,
      "semtypes": ["dsyn"],
      "icd10_codes": [{"code": "I10", "desc": "Essential (primary) hypertension"}],
      "snomed_codes": [{"code": "38341003", "desc": "Hypertensive disorder"}],
      "drg_codes": [{"drg": "683", "description": "DIABETES W/O CC/MCC"}],
      "negated": false
    }
  ],
  "suppressed_negated": [{"term": "Chest pain", "cui": "C0008031", "negated": true}],
  "features": { "USE_RAG": true, "ENABLE_DRG": false }
}
```

## Negation Handling & Suppressed Concepts

Hybrid strategy:
1. If `USE_MEDSPACY_CONTEXT=1`, attempt medSpaCy ConTextComponent (negation now; uncertainty/experiencer later).
2. If component load fails or flag off, fall back to internal heuristic (window + scope breakers + phrase cues).

Suppressed items surface in:

- API: `suppressed_negated` array.
- UI: Collapsible "Suppressed (Negated) Concepts" panel (auditing transparency).

Set `KEEP_NEGATED=1` to keep them in main result list (still flagged `negated: true`).

Limitations:
- No complex scope / double-negation handling yet.
- Plural & lemma variants partially handled (next iteration: lemma normalization pass).
- Future: reason codes / provenance chain.

## RAG vs Base Pipeline

| Aspect | Base | RAG |
|--------|------|-----|
| Extraction | QuickUMLS direct | QuickUMLS + semantic pre-filter |
| Scoring | Jaccard / fallback blended similarity | Adds `rag_relevance` contextual score |
| Retrieval | SQLite on demand | UnQLite cached multi-code retrieval |
| Negation | Implemented | Integration planned (shared utility) |
| Toggle | n/a | `USE_RAG=1` (API) |

Automatic fallback: if RAG returns zero concepts, base pipeline is invoked transparently.

## Observability
- `/features` â†’ feature flags + embedding model.
- `/health` â†’ liveness + semantic model name.
- `/ready` â†’ background UMLS initialization progress.

## Testing
- `tests/test_negation.py` basic negation cases.
- `tests/test_drg_toggle.py` DRG field presence under inpatient param.
- Recommended additions: `/features` contract test, similarity normalization edge case, suppressed panel HTML.

## Roadmap Excerpt
- Unify negation/dedup for RAG path.
- Provenance metadata (`applied_filters`, `suppression_reason`).
- Streaming partial results for long documents.
- Embedding cache warm snapshot export/import.
- Adaptive relevance threshold tuning.
